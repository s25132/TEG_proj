## QUERY GENERATION RULES (MANDATORY)

1. Use ONLY the node labels, relationship types, and properties defined above.
2. NEVER invent properties or relationship types.
3. Use case-insensitive matching for text fields using `toLower()`.
4. When filtering by dates, use Neo4j `date()` where applicable.
5. When counting results, return meaningful column names.
6. If the question asks for something unsupported by the schema, return an empty query.
7. Do NOT include explanations, comments, or any text outside the Cypher query.
8. If you search for RFP use Rfp label. Example "MATCH (r:Rfp) WHERE ..."

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY a valid Cypher query.

# Knowledge Graph Extraction Instructions (STRICT RFP SCHEMA)

You extract a knowledge graph ONLY for RFP documents from the input text.
The output MUST strictly follow the schema defined below.
DO NOT create any nodes, relationships, or properties outside this schema.
If the input is not an RFP, output an empty graph (no nodes, no relationships).

---

## ID RULE (MANDATORY)
For RFP.id you MUST create a deterministic unique id based on the title.
Example:
- title: "Senior Python Developers" -> id: "rfp_senior_python_developers"
Rules:
- lowercase
- replace spaces and non-alphanumerics with underscores
- prefix with "rfp_"
If title is missing, do NOT create any RFP node.

## ALLOWED NODE TYPES AND PROPERTIES (RFP ONLY)

### RFP
(RFP {{
  id,
  title,
  description,
  requirements,
  budget,
  deadline,
  document_type
}})

### Skill
(Skill {{
  id,
  category,
  subcategory
}})

---

## ALLOWED RELATIONSHIP TYPES AND PROPERTIES (RFP ONLY)

### RFP → Skill
(RFP)-[NEEDS {{
  required_count,
  experience_level
}}]->(Skill)

---

## RELATIONSHIP PROPERTY EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY)

When you create a NEEDS relationship:

1) You MUST extract relationship properties ONLY when values are explicitly present in the text.
2) If a NEEDS relationship exists but no valid property values are explicitly present, create the relationship WITHOUT properties.
3) NEVER infer, guess, or fabricate values.

### NEEDS
Extract:
- required_count only if explicitly present as a number (e.g., "required_count: 3", "need 3 engineers")
- experience_level only if explicitly present as a clear level label (e.g., "experience_level: senior", "mid", "junior")

---

## METADATA BLOCK (MANDATORY HANDLING)

The input text may contain a block:

[METADATA]
document_type: <VALUE>

If present, you MUST:
- Assign `document_type` to the RFP node exactly as provided.
- NEVER ignore this field.
- DO NOT infer or hallucinate document_type if missing.

---

## GENERAL EXTRACTION RULES

- Extract ONLY explicitly stated information.
- DO NOT guess missing values.
- DO NOT normalize or reinterpret values.
- DO NOT create placeholder or default values.
- If a property is not present in the text, omit it.
- The main node MUST be an RFP if anything is extracted.
- IDs must be stable and unique per entity (use deterministic IDs if possible).
- Use consistent entity resolution (same entity -> same node).

---

## OUTPUT RULES (CRITICAL)

- Output ONLY the extracted graph data.
- DO NOT include explanations, comments, or reasoning.
- DO NOT include text outside the graph structure.
- Ensure strict adherence to the defined schema.
